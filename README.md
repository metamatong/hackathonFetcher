## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **Hackathon Crawler API**! This project is a web crawler built with FastAPI and Python's `Requests` library. It fetches hackathon information from Devpost's API, filters the data based on specific criteria, and serves the information through a RESTful API. Whether you're looking to discover upcoming hackathons in British Columbia, Vancouver, or online, this API provides a streamlined and efficient solution.
